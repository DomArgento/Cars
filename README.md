Hi my name is Dom and for my website I am focusing on cars. My website was originally meant to be about video games but I realized it would be very long and hard, so I decided to make my website on cars. My website will give info on every car that is in porduction currently. There will be cars of the week and news updates. People will be able to comment and discuss about cars on the pages. There will be different catagories (ex. JDM, Muscle, Euro, etc.)
